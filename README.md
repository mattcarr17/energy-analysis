# Energy Analysis

Repo to store my work exploring data on the energy system.

## Data

The data is stored in the `data` folder. The data is not included in the repo, but can be downloaded from the following sources:
- EPA's [Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID)](https://www.epa.gov/energy/emissions-generation-resource-integrated-database-egrid)
